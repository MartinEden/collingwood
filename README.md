# collingwood
A simple implementation of the Battleships game for a prospective employer's coding challenge

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Collingwood_(1908)):

"HMS Collingwood was a St Vincent-class dreadnought battleship built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. She spent her whole career assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets and often served as a flagship ... her service during World War I generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea."

## Kotlin
I chose, possibly unwisely, to attempt this coding challenge in Kotlin, a language I haven't used before. This also entailed using TestNG and Mokito which, while standard, were both new to me. It's been an interesting experience! I have several questions about Kotlin that I will be asking on StackOverflow over the next few days.

## Building and running
Currently the code is only set up to build and run as an IntelliJ IDEA project. I can add a maven or gradle build if required, but adding one on now would delay my submission past this week.
