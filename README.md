From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Collingwood_(1908)):

"HMS Collingwood was a St Vincent-class dreadnought battleship built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. She spent her whole career assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets and often served as a flagship ... her service during World War I generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea."
